# Creative Corner

This is a frontend prototype created with Create React App and MUI library for front end design. It includes a few implemented features such as login, feed, create post, and like/reply functionalities. Please note that many backend functionalities are not completed, and this is just a prototype.

A demo version of the app is available at https://creativecorner-97e71.web.app/.

## Getting Started

To get started:

1. Clone the repository.

2. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.

3. Run `npm start` to start the app in development mode. It will open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser. You can make edits to the code, and the page will reload with your changes.

4. Run `npm test` to launch the test runner in interactive watch mode for running tests.

5. Run `npm run build` to build the app for production. It will create a `build` folder with optimized and minified files ready for deployment.

Please note that `npm run eject` is a one-way operation and should be used with caution. It allows you to customize the build tool and configuration choices, but it cannot be undone.
